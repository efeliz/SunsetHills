# SunsetHills
This is the repo for CFâ€™s Sunset on the Hills Coding Challenge.

**Live Demo:** https://efeliz.github.io/SunsetHills/

## Official Prompt
An array of buildings is facing the sun. The
heights of each building from West to East is
given in an integer array. You have to tell which
buildings will be able to see the sunset.
Write a program that prints how many buildings
and which buildings will be able to see the

Sunset given the Array of building heights:
[3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 9].

The output should look something like this:
4 --> [3, 4, 7, 9]

## Implementation & Features
- Building Editor (customize & your favorite buildings)
- Random Scene Generator (generates a scene with the parameters set by user - buildings and heights are varied to keep things fun!)
- Sliders (range inputs) for all data entries (with step points)
- Key Metrics: provides user with several important details about the scene generated i.e. number of buildings, visible, tallest, etc.
- Building Sunset Visibility: buildings that can see sunset will be in full color, while those blocked are gray + transparent.
- Scene Clearer (removes all items from screen for a positive UX)
- Fullscreen Mode: makes it easier to view all of the buildings (and all of their beauty)
- Responsive Design: built with cross-platform support in mind - whether you're on mobile, a tablet, or a desktop you should be good!
- Dynamic Scene Generation: placement of objects is not fixed, all background elements are placed at scene creation based on calculations being made.

## Graphics/UI
All the graphics were designed by me in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer) (a vector illustration program - think Adobe Illustrator)

**NOTE:** be sure to try out the "special" office buildings designed with CoderFoundry & Logitech in mind!

## Special Thanks
I want to personally thank CoderFoundry (Kevin Doyle & Bobby Davis Jr.) for putting this fun challenge together. Thank you Logitech for sponsoring the challenge and offering a ***kind*** prize.

## Final Thoughts & Comments
Is it perfect? No. Juggling back and forth between school and the coding challenge has been fun... heh. Ultimately, I gave it my best shot with the time that I could. I had a couple of other ideas and features planned... but time. I've been off the grid these past few days so I'm excited to finally see what everyone's come up with!
